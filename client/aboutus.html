            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Purpose of App: This app was created to help manage a group of folks arrive at their airport at the same time.
            This could be for an extended family arriving at a family reunion even though family members are flying in from
            multiple locations.  This app could also be used to link up friends for a family vacation.  The intent is that
            the airport is a convenient linking location.  This task is incredibly difficult to do via today's available
            scheduling methods.  </p>
